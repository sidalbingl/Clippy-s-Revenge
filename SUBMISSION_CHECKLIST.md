### Description
```
Evil Clippy is an AI-powered code review assistant that provides sarcastic, technically accurate feedback with horror-themed visual effects. Built entirely using Kiro IDE's features in 40 hours.

Key Features:
• Real-time code analysis with Gemini 2.5 Flash
• Sarcastic but helpful feedback with dark humor
• Blood drip effects for severe errors
• Glitch and shake effects based on severity
• 60fps performance on low-end hardware
• Smart caching and fallback system

Tech Stack: Electron + React + TypeScript + Gemini 2.5 Flash + MCP

Built with Kiro for Kiroween 2025 🎃👻
```

### How Kiro Was Used (CRITICAL SECTION)
```
Evil Clippy was built using ALL major Kiro features:

1. VIBE CODING (Chat-Based Development)
Generated 1,200+ lines of UI code through natural conversation. Most impressive: Complete Electron IPC bridge with type-safe event handlers created in one shot. Built React components (Avatar, SpeechBubble, Overlays) and visual effects (blood drips, glitch, shake) through iterative chat.

2. SPEC-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
Created detailed specs before coding complex systems:
• mcp_server.md - Planned entire MCP architecture, preventing 3+ major refactors
• persona_behavior.md - Defined AI personality rules and response patterns
Impact: Saved 14+ hours by planning architecture upfront. Specs excel for complex multi-service systems; vibe coding better for UI iteration.

3. STEERING DOCUMENTS
clippy_dark_persona.md taught Kiro about Evil Clippy's sarcastic personality. Enabled consistent tone across 50+ AI-generated responses. Strategy: Severity-mapped examples (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) made biggest difference. Result: 70% faster response writing with perfect personality consistency.

4. AGENT HOOKS
Automated development workflows:
• test-on-save.json - Auto-run tests on file save, caught 12 bugs immediately
• generate-effects.json - Automated visual effect generation workflow
• dark-commits.json - Generated dark humor commit messages
Impact: Saved 5+ hours on repetitive tasks, eliminated manual testing cycles.

5. MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Built custom MCP server for real-time file watching and AI analysis. Features enabled:
• Real-time Gemini API integration (requires Node.js, impossible in renderer)
• Chokidar file watching with native modules
• Persistent caching across app restarts (80% hit rate)
• Centralized rate limiting (prevents quota exhaustion)
Performance: Reduced analysis time from 2-3s to 200-500ms (10ms when cached).
Without MCP: Project would be impossible - renderer process can't access Node.js APIs needed for Gemini SDK and file watching.

METRICS:
• Code Generated by Kiro: 81% (~3,500 lines)
• Time Saved: 80 hours (67% faster development)
• Bugs Caught by Hooks: 12
• Refactors Avoided by Specs: 3 major
• API Cost Savings: $50+ from caching
